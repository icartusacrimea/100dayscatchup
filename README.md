# 100dayscatchup
for when you've tweeted about but neglected to log #100DaysofCode days on your GitHub repo

The first part of the project just prints out markup text for all 100 days that you can copy/paste into your log.md file of your forked 100-days-of-code template<br><br>
**Instructions:**<br>
1. Change **startDate** to your own start date, taking note of commented instructions to create your Date object one month earlier than your desired date. (Reason for this is months are listed as 0-11 range, which is a common behavior in many languages.)<br>
Format is ('YYYY','MM','DD').<br>
Example: My start date was Jan 3 2017; I used Date('2016','12','03');<br><br>
2. Run the file in your browser. You will be able to copy/paste this Github-flavored markdown into your log.md file<br><br>

NOTE: I'm currently working on implementing a method to take an archive of all your tweets around #100daysofcode hashtag and easily insert days with descriptions and any links or photos included into the markup.
